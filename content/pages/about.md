Outcome Unknown was originally conceived as a newsletter and community in 2014. Like so many new parents, after our first kid (Cassidy) was born I started reading a lot of books and articles on all sorts of parenting topics. I noticed not just a lack of what I refer to as parenting real talk, but a lack of a father's perspective on parenting so I created something. I'm just winging it like everyone else out there, sharing some stories and links along the way. It's written and curated by me, [Brad Barrish](https://whatevernevermind.com).

Here's a nice photo of the family I write about.
